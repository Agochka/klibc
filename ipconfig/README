BOOTP/DHCP client for klibc
---------------------------

Notes:

1. This client is able to configure multiple interfaces if required:

	ipconfig -d eth0 -d eth1

   It will wait for all listed interfaces to complete bootp/dhcp
   configuration.

2. We should have a timeout parameter:

	ipconfig -t 30

   so we can optionally bound the time we allow for the configuration
   to complete.

3. We should let the user specify the configuration protocol
   (maybe per-interface?)  The code internally supports per-interface.

4. Static IP configuration.

5. Command line arguments.  Maybe we should accept an ip= string on the
   command line to remain compatible with the kernel?

6. The code in main.c is yucky imho.  Needs cleaning.
