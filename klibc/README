This is klibc, what is intended to be a minimalistic libc subset for
use with initramfs.  It is deliberately written for small size,
minimal entaglement and portability, not speed.  It is definitely a
work in progress, and a lot of things are still missing.


The build procedure is not very polished yet, but it should work like
this:

a) Create a symlink called "linux" pointing to a reasonably recent
   Linux kernel tree (2.4 or 2.5 should be OK.)  This tree must have
   the include/asm symlink set up for the architecture you're
   compiling for, and include/linux/autoconf.h must exist.  The
   easiest way to make sure of all of these is to do a "make config"
   or any of its variants on the kernel tree is question, followed by
   a "make dep".

b) If you're cross-compiling, change ARCH in the main MCONFIG file to
   the appropriate architecture, and set CROSS to your toolchain prefix.

c) Type "make" and pray...

d) Try the test programs in the tests/ directory.  They should run...
